This script lists quotes given a particular id, with uris such as
"http://substack.net/projects/database-security/quotes/?quote_id=8".

The id however is passed directly through to the query's where clause.
For the previous uri, the database executes:
    select * from quotes where id=8

Instead of just listing a particular post, by giving a quote id of "8 or 1"
for instance, the query becomes
    select * from quotes where id=8 or 1
which is the same as
    select * from quotes
because the where clause is always true.

All the attacker needs to do is visit
"http://substack.net/projects/database-security/quotes/?quote_id=8 or 1"
in order to list all the posts, including the secret one.
